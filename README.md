# CarDekho-Price-Prediction

Problem Statement:
The used car market in India is a dynamic and ever-changing landscape. Prices can fluctuate wildly based on a variety of factors including the make and model of the car, its mileage, its condition and the current market conditions. As a result, it can be difficult for sellers to accurately price their cars.

Approach:
We propose to develop a machine learning model that can predict the price of a used car based on its features. The model will be trained on a dataset of used cars that have been sold on Cardekho.com in India. The model will then be able to be used to predict the price of any used car, given its features.

Objective
To build suitable Machine Learning Model for Used Car Price Prediction.

Benefits:
The benefits of this solution include:

Sellers will be able to more accurately price their cars which will help them to sell their cars faster and for a higher price.
Buyers will be able to find cars that are priced more competitively.
The overall used car market in India will become more efficient.
